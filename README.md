## What each File contains
1. **sumupto.py** contains my solution for  problem 1 in problem set.<br />
    *It ask user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number.*
2.  **begins-with-t.py** contains my solution for  problem 2 in problem set.<br />
    *It displays whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T.*
3. **divisors.py** contains my solution for  problem 3 in problem set<br />
    *It prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.*
4. **collatz.py** contains my solution for  problem 4 in problem set.<br />
*It asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value bytakingthecurrentvalueand,ifitiseven,divideitbytwo,butifitisodd,multiply it by three and add one.*
5. **primes.py** contains my solution for  problem 5 in problem set.<br />*It asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime.*
6. **secondstring.py** contains my solution for  problem 6 in problem set.<br />*It takes a user input string and outputs every second word.*
7. **squareroot.py** contains my solution for  problem 7 in problem set.<br />*It takes a positive ﬂoating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.*
