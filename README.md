# Problem Set

This repositery contains my solution to the problem set 2019 for the Module
Programming and Scripting at GMIT.@Freha

## What each File contains

1. **sumupto.py** contains my solution for  problem 1 in problem set.<br />
        <p>*It ask user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number. first in program it check the input to make sure number is positive (refernce:https://stackoverflow.com/a/23294659), if valid input it call the function sum and pass this input as an argument that fuction use while loop to calculate sum and return that sum value that  is printed* </p>
 ---       
2.  **begins-with-t.py** contains my solution for  problem 2 in problem set.<br />
        <p>*It displays whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T. datetime module is imported The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. method datetime.today().weekday() Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6, of the current local datetime. that value was assigned to a variable and as only days 1 (Tuesday) and 3(Thursday) are the days started with T for if - else statement is used to print output * </p>
 ---      
3. **divisors.py** contains my solution for  problem 3 in problem set<br />
        <p>*It prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.* </p>
---       
4. **collatz.py** contains my solution for  problem 4 in problem set.<br />
         <p>*It asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and,if it is even,divide it by two,but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.* </p>
 ---       
5. **primes.py** contains my solution for  problem 5 in problem set.<br />
        <p>*It asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime.*</p>
---
6. **secondstring.py** contains my solution for  problem 6 in problem set.<br />
        <p>*It takes a user input string and outputs every second word.*</p>
 ---     
7. **squareroot.py** contains my solution for  problem 7 in problem set.<br />
        <p>*It takes a positive ﬂoating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.*</p>
---        
8. **datetime.py** contains my solution for  problem 8 in problem set.<br />
        <p>*It outputs today’s dateand time in the format“Monday,January 10 2019 at 1:15pm”.*</p>
 ---     
9. **second.py** contains my solution for  problem 9 in problem set.<br />
         <p>*It reads in a textﬁle and outputs every secondline. This program takes the ﬁlename from an argument on the command line.*</p>
 ---      
10. **plot.py** contains my solution for  problem 10 in problem set.<br />
          <p>*It displays a plot of the functions x, x square and 2 raise to power x in the range [0,4]. use matplotlib to plot the graph*</p>
